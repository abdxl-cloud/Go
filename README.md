# 🏎️ Goofing Around with Go  

Welcome to my Go playground! This is where I break things, fix them (sometimes), and learn Go along the way.  

## 📌 What's in here?  
- Go basics 🏗️  
- Experiments & mistakes 💥  
- Random "Aha!" moments 💡  

## 🚀 Running the Code  
Make sure you have Go installed, then:  
```sh
go run main.go
```

## 🤝 Contribute?
You can, but why would you? 😂

Enjoy the chaos! 🎉
